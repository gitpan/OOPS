Added support for SQLite. 

Discovered that DBD::Pg doesn't handle ascii null without
using bind_param().  Now bind_param() is used.

Added more regression tests: null.t, bigblob.t

Modified slowtest.t so we can skip to a specific test.

Removed the requirement that a username be specified for DBI.

The problem I had with SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL in mysql
turns out to be my mistake: it sets the level for the _next_
transaction, not the current one.  The LOCK IN SHARE MODE hack
has been removed.

Added load_object() to the OOPS::FrontEnd to match the documentation
on hand-written queries.  Also added dbh() to OOPS::FrontEnd to support
hand-written queries.

Added a quick check for schema version compatability.

Minor changes to the license.
