2006/09/06 0.1005 - minor tweaks

	Removed some extraneous debugging printouts

	Allow 'username' and 'pass' as aliases for 'user' and 'password' when

2006/07/04 0.1004 - focus on: bugfixes, PostgreSQL schema change, SQLite2 vs SQLite 3

	Change the license to GPL.

	This release tested on:

		perl 5.8.7, PostgreSQL 8.1.4, Ubuntu 6.06LTS (Dapper Drake)

		perl 5.8.7, DBD::SQLite2 0.33 (sqlite 2.8.15), Ubuntu 6.06LTS (Dapper Drake)

		perl 5.8.7, mysql 4.1.15, Ubuntu 6.06LTS (Dapper Drake)

	Not supported (did not pass tests):

		perl 5.8.7, DBD::SQLite 1.12 (sqlite 3.2.7), Ubuntu 6.06LTS (Dapper Drake)

	New features:
		
		none

	Bugfixes:

		References to hash keys where the key is a large string now work
		(except when using mysql).

		Change one column definition in the PostgreSQL schema.   This
		fixes a PostgreSQL compatability bug and this change is required
		whem moving from PostgreSQL 7.* to PostgreSQL 8.*.  Reported
		by Jon Schindler.  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19723

		Bugfix: schema upgrades from 1001 to 1003 weren't always recorded
		correctly.

		Don't fail tests if Test::MultiFork isn't installed.

		SQLite 3 wouldn't auto-initialize.

		SQLite 3 gives different error messages and that caused errors
		rather than raising a deadlock exception.

		Old versions of Data::Compare will recursse infinately.  Don't
		even try!  Unfortunantly Debian (and Ubuntu) include very old
		versions of Data::Compare.

	Other changes:

		Ran ispell on OOPS.pod and made other edits.

		Added new tests (misc2.t, big.t, upgrade1003.t, failures.t)

		Added a new test harness: supercross7()

		Added support for DBD::SQLite2, auto-detect SQLite version.

		Dropped ab-loopspeed.t in favor of Time::HiRes.

2004/05/19 0.1003 - focus on: new features

	Added hooks to upgrade the schema when the schema is changed and
	to use an older version of OOPS if auto_upgrade isn't set and the
	schema can't be upgraded.

	Added auto_initialize.

	Removed some of the redundent regression tests.

	Fixed a bug in the tran1.t and tran1a.t test scripts.

2004/05/16 0.1002 - focus on: Pg bugfix and SQLite addtion

	Added support for SQLite. 

	Discovered that DBD::Pg doesn't handle ascii null without
	using bind_param().  Now bind_param() is used.

	Added more regression tests: null.t, bigblob.t

	Modified slowtest.t so we can skip to a specific test.

	Removed the requirement that a username be specified for DBI.

	The problem I had with SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL in mysql
	turns out to be my mistake: it sets the level for the _next_
	transaction, not the current one.  The LOCK IN SHARE MODE hack
	has been removed.

	Added load_object() to the OOPS::FrontEnd to match the documentation
	on hand-written queries.  Also added dbh() to OOPS::FrontEnd to support
	hand-written queries.

	Added a quick check for schema version compatability.

	Minor changes to the license.

2004/05/10 0.1001 - focus on: reliability
