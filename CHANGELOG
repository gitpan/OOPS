2004/05/19 0.1003 - focus on: new features

	Added hooks to upgrade the schema when the schema is changed and
	to use an older version of OOPS if auto_upgrade isn't set and the
	schema can't be upgraded.

	Added auto_initialize.

	Removed some of the redundent regression tests.

	Fixed a bug in the tran1.t and tran1a.t test scripts.

2004/05/16 0.1002 - focus on: Pg bugfix and SQLite addtion

	Added support for SQLite. 

	Discovered that DBD::Pg doesn't handle ascii null without
	using bind_param().  Now bind_param() is used.

	Added more regression tests: null.t, bigblob.t

	Modified slowtest.t so we can skip to a specific test.

	Removed the requirement that a username be specified for DBI.

	The problem I had with SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL in mysql
	turns out to be my mistake: it sets the level for the _next_
	transaction, not the current one.  The LOCK IN SHARE MODE hack
	has been removed.

	Added load_object() to the OOPS::FrontEnd to match the documentation
	on hand-written queries.  Also added dbh() to OOPS::FrontEnd to support
	hand-written queries.

	Added a quick check for schema version compatability.

	Minor changes to the license.
